This Plugin contains three different features.

Custom Post Type
This is a Custom Page, that is different than the Pages/Posts option included
in any wordpress theme. This allows the users to add posts that would be generated
specifically to that page and no where else. So it can almost work like a second blog 
page but making it custom allows the user to completely customize the features
and contents of the page.

Widget
A custom widget is included in the plugin that generates a random post from 
the custom post type on the every time the viewer clicks on something or refreshes the 
page. It is just a regular widget and can be added on any of the menus in the theme.

Shortcode
A custom shortcode has been created to make the featured image of a post appear as a 
thumbnail on the Custom Post Type page. The user can choose to remove the thumbnail, simply
by clicking edit post and removing the tag
